# WoW-Launcher
This is my launcher for WoW that I've been using for years to make playing on multiple private servers a lot easier. It includes a customizable list of servers from which users can choose, allowing you to quickly change your realmlist or visit the server's website. This is a purely practical application and does not feature any fancy interface designs that could slow down loading times or confuse the user. To edit the server list, simply double click on the big "Realmlist" label, and the configuration window will show up. You can also edit the list manually by opening the launcher.cfg file located in the game folder.

- Written in pure C89 without using the standard library.

- Compiles with any C compiler, including MinGW and MSVC 6.0.

- Runs on any version of Windows, even ancient ones.
